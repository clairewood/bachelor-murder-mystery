# bachelor-murder-mystery
The Bachelor (the tv show) meets Clue (the murder-mystery board game) in this text-based game.

Don't judge her, she's a work in progress! I am attempting to work on this while pursuing my CS post-bacc degree (in all of the extremely abundant spare time I have).

In it's final form it will be a short text-based game that allows the user to interact with room-bound characters and guess the murderer and the murder weapon. If incorrect, you can keep playing the game or quit. If correct, you'll receive the grand prize of: bragging rights. That's it.

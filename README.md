The Bachelor (the tv show) meets Clue (the murder-mystery board game) in this text-based game.

This is a work in progress that I am creating in my spare time. In it's final form it will be a short text-based game that allows the user to interact with room-bound characters and guess the murderer and the murder weapon. If correct, you'll receive the grand prize of: bragging rights, I guess.
